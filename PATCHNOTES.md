# Patches

## Patch 1.01
Patch 1.01 was implemented after initial feedback on the web page from a group of friends, family, course colleagues and project assessor.

### Feedback
- The modal background does not extend past the bottom of the screen when scrolling. This is logged as Bug 7 and fixed.
- The 404 return button is easily missed.
- The guessing table page can be "too busy".
- More guidance on how to play would be appreciated.
- A visible slide bar on the how-to-play and contact-me modals is required.
- The deployment information in the README.md file could be more descriptive.
- The target audience and purpose of the site could be better described in the README.md file.
- A button to see the cards again once on the guessing stage would be nice.
- Set difficulties with set number of cards and checking chances would make it more streamlined.
- More security needs to be implemented to reduce spam and ensure the safety of user data.
